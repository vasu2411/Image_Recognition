So here, model will be trained by 50000 images and their class and after that user can test our trained model by giving image and get appropriate class name.

Here, We have 2 files Image Recognition Trainer.py and Image Recognition Tester.py. First run Trainer file to train our model and then run tester file to test our trained model.
